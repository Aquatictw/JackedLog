## Integration Check

**Cross-Phase Wiring:** All phases independent, no conflicts

| Connection | Status |
|------------|--------|
| StatCard → overview_page.dart | ✓ WIRED |
| showMenu → history_page.dart | ✓ WIRED |
| ExercisePickerModal → workout_detail_page.dart | ✓ WIRED |
| SetRow → workout_detail_page.dart | ✓ WIRED |
| ReorderableListView → notes_page.dart | ✓ WIRED |
| sequence column → notes queries | ✓ WIRED |

**Database:** v62 migration safe and backward-compatible

## E2E Flow Verification

### Flow 1: View Total Workout Time ✓
User opens Overview → sees Total Time card → changes period → value updates

### Flow 2: History Search Without Menu ✓
User opens History → search bar has no three-dots menu

### Flow 3: Edit Workout ✓
User opens workout → taps edit → modifies name/exercises/sets → saves → changes persist

### Flow 4: Reorder Notes ✓
User opens Notes → long-press drags note → releases → order persists after restart

## Tech Debt

**None accumulated.** All phases implemented cleanly with no deferred items.

## Anti-Patterns

**None detected** across all three phases:
- No TODO/FIXME/XXX/HACK comments
- No placeholder implementations
- No empty returns or stubs
- No console.log-only handlers

## Gaps

**None.** All requirements satisfied, all integrations verified, all flows complete.

## Conclusion

Milestone v1 is **ready for completion**. All 13 requirements delivered across 3 phases with full integration and no tech debt.
