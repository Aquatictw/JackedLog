# Notes Feature Implementation

## Overview
A creative, artistic notes feature has been implemented for Flexify! Users can now create, edit, and manage colorful notes that persist across sessions and can be exported.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema (v52)
- **New Table: `Notes`**
  - `id` (autoincrement, primary key)
  - `title` (text)
  - `content` (text)
  - `created` (DateTime)
  - `updated` (DateTime)
  - `color` (nullable int - color palette index)

**Files Created/Modified:**
- `lib/database/notes.dart` - Notes table definition
- `lib/database/database.dart` - Added Notes table and migration from v51 to v52
- `drift_schemas/db/drift_schema_v52.json` - Schema JSON for version 52
- `lib/database/settings.dart` - Updated default tabs to include NotesPage

### 2. User Interface
**Artistic Design Features:**
- **Grid Layout**: Beautiful 2-column masonry grid of note cards
- **8 Vibrant Colors**: Peach, Mint, Sky Blue, Pink, Coral, Light Yellow, Mint Green, and Lavender
- **Search Functionality**: Real-time search through note titles and content
- **Smooth Animations**: Polished card interactions with Material Design 3
- **Empty State**: Helpful placeholder when no notes exist

**Files Created:**
- `lib/notes/notes_page.dart` - Main notes list view with grid layout
- `lib/notes/note_editor_page.dart` - Full-screen note editor with color picker

**Features:**
- Create, edit, and delete notes
- Choose from 8 artistic color themes per note
- Search notes by title or content
- Auto-save prompts when leaving unsaved notes
- Timestamp display (last updated)
- Responsive grid layout

### 3. Navigation Integration
- Added NotesPage to bottom navigation bar
- Note icon (Icons.note_rounded) in bottom nav
- Default tabs now include: History, Plans, Graphs, Timer, **Notes**, Settings

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/home_page.dart` - Added NotesPage route
- `lib/bottom_nav.dart` - Added Notes icon and label

### 4. Export Functionality
- Export notes to CSV format
- Includes all note data: id, title, content, created date, updated date, and color
- Integrated into existing export data dialog

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/export_data.dart` - Added Notes export option

## What Needs to Be Done

### Required: Run Database Migration
Since the Flutter environment isn't set up in this session, you need to run the migration script to generate the required database code:

```bash
./scripts/migrate.sh
```

This script will:
1. Run `dart run build_runner build -d` - Generates database.g.dart with new Notes table
2. Run `drift_dev make-migrations` - Creates migration steps
3. Run `drift_dev schema generate` - Updates schema files

**Alternative (if migrate.sh doesn't work):**
```bash
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```

### Testing Checklist
After running the migration, test the following:

1. **App Launches Successfully**
   - Verify no database migration errors
   - Check that all tabs are visible including Notes

2. **Create Notes**
   - Tap the Notes tab
   - Tap the + icon
   - Enter title and content
   - Select a color
   - Save the note

3. **Edit Notes**
   - Tap an existing note
   - Modify title/content
   - Change color
   - Verify changes persist

4. **Delete Notes**
   - Long-press or use delete icon
   - Confirm deletion dialog
   - Verify note is removed

5. **Search Notes**
   - Type in search bar
   - Verify filtering works
   - Clear search

6. **Export Notes**
   - Go to Settings → Export data
   - Select "Notes"
   - Verify CSV export works

7. **Persistence**
   - Create some notes
   - Close and reopen the app
   - Verify all notes are still there

## Design Philosophy

The notes feature was designed to be:
- **Artistic**: Vibrant color palette inspired by modern note-taking apps
- **Intuitive**: Simple, clean interface following Material Design 3
- **Integrated**: Seamlessly fits into existing Flexify architecture
- **Performant**: Uses Drift streams for real-time updates
- **Exportable**: Notes data can be backed up via CSV export

## Color Palette

The 8 artistic colors chosen for notes:
1. **Peach** (#FFD6A5) - Warm and inviting
2. **Mint** (#CAFAFA) - Fresh and clean
3. **Sky Blue** (#A0C4FF) - Calm and peaceful
4. **Pink** (#FFC6FF) - Soft and gentle
5. **Coral** (#FFADAD) - Vibrant and energetic
6. **Light Yellow** (#FDFFB6) - Bright and cheerful
7. **Mint Green** (#B9FBC0) - Natural and soothing
8. **Lavender** (#BDB2FF) - Creative and inspiring

## Architecture Notes

Following Flexify's existing patterns:
- **Provider pattern**: Could add NotesState if needed for complex state management
- **Stream-based UI**: Uses Drift's `.watch()` for real-time updates
- **Offline-first**: Pure SQLite with no network dependency
- **Material Design 3**: Consistent with app's design language

## Summary

The notes feature is **fully implemented** and ready to use once you run the migration script. It provides a beautiful, intuitive way for users to keep workout-related notes, meal plans, goals, or any other fitness-related information right within Flexify!

The implementation follows all Flexify conventions and integrates seamlessly with the existing codebase. Notes are stored locally in SQLite, ensuring privacy and offline availability.
