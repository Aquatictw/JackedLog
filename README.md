## About This Fork

## Getting Started

3. **Run the App**: Launch the Flexify app on your Android device or emulator:

## Migrations

If you edit any of the models in the `lib/database` directory you probably need to create migrations. E.g. assume the version starts at `1`.

1. Bump the `schemaVersion`
   `lib/database/database.dart`

```dart
  int get schemaVersion => 2;
```

2. Run database migrations

```sh
./scripts/migrate.sh
```

3. Add the migration step
   `lib/database/database.dart`

```dart
from1To2: (Migrator m, Schema2 schema) async {
  await m.addColumn(schema.myTable, schema.myTable.myColumn);
},
```
